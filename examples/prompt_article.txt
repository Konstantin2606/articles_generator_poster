Write the article so that it can be posted on a blog, add more specifics, details, context, and original expressions. Emphasize specific examples and use of data to strengthen the uniqueness of the text. Avoid using any clich√©s or wording often found on the internet. The article should be written in an original way, with new ideas and unique structure.

The article should be well optimized for SEO (Google and Yandex). All long-tail key phrases (long-tail keywords) should be organically embedded in the text of the article in their exact form where possible. If a phrase is too cumbersome to use naturally, it is acceptable to use variations or synonyms, preserving the meaning. Check the text for uniqueness through special services to exclude even random coincidences.
